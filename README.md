# Simple-Linear-Regression-Model
A simple linear regression model, made in Google Colab using a salary dataset taken from "Kaggle".
📈 Simple Linear Regression Model
This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model using Python. The goal is to understand the relationship between two variables and predict the outcome of a dependent variable based on the value of an independent variable.

🔍 Overview
Linear regression is one of the most basic and widely used algorithms in machine learning. It assumes a linear relationship between the input variable (X) and the output variable (Y).

In this project, I:
-> Generate or load sample data
-> Visualize the data using matplotlib
-> Train a linear regression model
-> Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
-> Make predictions
